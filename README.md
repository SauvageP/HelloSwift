# HelloSwift
This was a proof of concept on understanding how Xcode works and how to push
and pull changes from github. With this repo, I was able to initialize, push 
and pull through the terminal and add my ssh keys without fail. 

This is the first step in my 1000 mile trip to becoming a engineer.
